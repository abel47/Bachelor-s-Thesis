Data Mining is a field in computer science # which deals with the gaining of informatin out of the data given # In recent years has encountered a more deep approach because of the implication it has in business, economy or politics #. The key factors that Data Mining is dealing with are the inference of information from data by searching and finding patterns in the data. # With this taken into account, a lot of pattern recognition algorithms have been developed in order to facilitate this process #

In this work, the problem of reducing the data set will be approached. For this, the feature selection method? # has been used. Feature Selection is usefulf becaus of the problem? that many # real world data sets have, big dimmensions. Big dimensions translates into a large number of features (atributes) the entries have #. Therefore Feature Selection comes in helping by reducing the number of features that the dataset has #, by deleting? the irrelevant features of it, thus reducing the dimensionality.

For this task the python library # along with sciklearn # and skikit multi learn # libraries have been used.

As ide's spyder# and jupyter# have been used in acomplishing the task  .
